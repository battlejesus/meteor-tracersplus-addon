## Enhanced Tracers

This feature updates the original `Tracers` module by resolving target identification issues and adding new filtering options.

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
* **Clear Target Differentiation:** In the original version, tracer colors were assigned based on player ranks or team colors. This made it difficult to immediately distinguish between a player and a mob/animal/etc. The coloring logic has been reworked to prioritize entity types, ensuring clear visibility.

### New Features
* **Friend Highlighting:** Players on your friends list are now displayed with a distinct, custom color to easily separate them from regular players.
* **"Only Friends" Toggle:** Added a dedicated button to filter out other entities, rendering tracers exclusively for your friends to reduce screen clutter in crowded areas.
